# Scripts Provenance

This repository contains the source code of the survey "A Survey on Collecting, Managing, and Analyzing Provenance from Scripts".

We applied forward and backward snowballing using the [snowballing library](https://github.com/JoaoFelipe/snowballing) to identify the state-of-the-art tools on provenance from scripts. During this process, we visited 1345 references and ended with 53 papers referring to 27 approaches, as presented in the selected citation graph or in the full citation graph.

Based on the obtained approaches, we propose a taxonomy to classify provenance from scripts. We also provide a small description of each approach. 

Please, visit our the survey website at [http://dew-uff.github.io/scripts-provenance](http://dew-uff.github.io/scripts-provenance).
