        "One approach is based on executing experiments in a virtual environment, such as virtual machines or cloud [3].",
        
4
        "This approach is used in the CDE system (Code, Data, and Environment packaging) [4].",
        
5
        "Should also be mentioned electronic notebooks, such as Hivebench [5].",

        "Some of them are aimed at a particular domain, for example Madagascar [6] is used to analyze seismic data and supports multidimensional data analysis; and Sumatra is used for numerical computations.",
        
7
        "The prepared computational package is transferred to the user’s directory in the parallel computing system through the SSH protocol using the Paramiko [7] library.",
