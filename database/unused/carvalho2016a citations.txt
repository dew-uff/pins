"This is witnessed by a number of initiatives that were launched to bring some of the rich features that traditionally come with scientiﬁc workﬂow systems to manage scripts, see e.g., [1]–[4].",
        "For example, McPhilips et al. [1] developed YesWorkﬂow, an environment for extracting a workﬂow-like graph that depicts the main components that compose a script and their data dependencies based on comments that annotate the script.",
        "To do so, we adopt the YesWorkﬂow tool [1], [4].",
        "We can thus pose Datalog queries against this ﬁle to reveal data ﬂow and dependencies within a script. Such queries, as mentioned in [1], can, for instance, allowtheusertolisttheactivitiesdeﬁnedinthescriptandtheir descriptions (when provided by the curator) or the activities that invoke a particular module or external program.",
        "We adopted YesWorkﬂow [1], [4] to generate the abstract workﬂow visualizations before creating the executable workﬂow (step 1 of our methodology).",

"This is witnessed by a number of initiatives that were launched to bring some of the rich features that traditionally come with scientiﬁc workﬂow systems to manage scripts, see e.g., [1]–[4].",
        "On the other hand, the provenance traces captured using noWorkﬂow are ﬁne-grained, and therefore cumbersome, for the user who would like to understand the lineage of the script results [2].",

        "Murta et al. [3] proposed noWorkﬂow, which also captures provenance traces of script executions.",

"To address the above issues and complement the landscape of solutions proposed by the community for promoting the reuse and reproducibility of scripts, we present in this paper a methodology for converting scripts into reproducible Workﬂow Research Objects [5] (WRO).",
        "To meet the requirements identiﬁed in Section III, we devised a methodology for converting a script into reproducible workﬂow research objects [5], [8].",
        "These richly annotation objects are called workﬂow-centric research objects [5].",
        "Workﬂow Research Objects [5] (WRO) are a speciﬁc kind of Research Objects that can be viewed as an aggregation of resources that bundles a workﬂow speciﬁcation and additional information to preserve the workﬂows and their context.",

"In our case, a suite of scripts was designed by physiochemists [6]; its inputs are the protein structure (obtained from the RCSB PDB protein data bank3), the simulation parameters and force ﬁeld ﬁles.",

7
"As stressed by [7], provenance that is provided by the execution of a workﬂow corresponds to a workﬂow trace, which can be processed as an acyclic digraph, in which nodes are activities and/or data, and edges denote relationships among activities and data",
        "We follow the deﬁnition of [7]: ”reproducibility denotes the ability for a third party who has access to the description of the original experiment and its results to reproduce those results using a possibly different setting, with the goal of conﬁrming or disputing the original experimenter’s claims.” [7] also differentiates reproducibility from repeatability, for which results must be the same, and no changes are made anywhere.",
        "Part of related work was already discussed in the text, e.g., the work of [7] for workﬂow equivalenc",
        "Our preliminary work towards this goal is based on [7], and their PDIFF algorithm that compares workﬂow traces, produced by their SWFMS environment, e-Science Central.",

"To meet the requirements identiﬁed in Section III, we devised a methodology for converting a script into reproducible workﬂow research objects [5], [8].",
        "The Workﬂow Research Object model allows curators to aggregate resources and explicitly specify the relationship between these resources and the workﬂow in a machinereadable format using a suite of ontologies [8].",
        
9
"A Research Object [9] provides the means to specify a kind of container that gathers resources of different types and provides a digital analogue of the ’Materials and Methods’ section of a research paper.",

"Once the curator speciﬁes the implementation of each activity in Wa, a concrete workﬂow speciﬁcation We that is conform to a given scientiﬁc workﬂow system can be created.Withoutlossofgenerality,weusedtheTavernasystem [10], although our solution can be adapted to other scientiﬁc workﬂow systems.",

11
"Another (more system-speciﬁc) example of the construction of executable workﬂows from source code is pursued in [11].",

"Examples include HyperFlow [12], StarFlow [13] and Swift [14].",

15
"The work of [15] proposes an executable visual-based representation of a workﬂow",

16
"This was extended by [16] to allow scientists two alternative ways of working with workﬂows: script-based and visual-based representations",
        "[16] argues that, in some cases, scripts are preferable to specify workﬂows since scientists may want to look at code.",

17
"Yet another possibility to compare workﬂows appears in [17]",
        

Annotations describe the operations performed by the workflow, links to other resources, such as the provenance of the results obtained by executing the workflow
