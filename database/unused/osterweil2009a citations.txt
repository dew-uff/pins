        "This goal has already been achieved and we discuss this later in Section 5.1. lbsh is open source, is freely available via its website[2], and users are encouraged (though not required) to provide feedback via its online usage questionnaire, forums, and bug tracker.",

--------------------

Isolate experiments into lab-books
All commands logged in a lbsh session are recorded and stored in a lab-book

User-shell monitor: logs commands and meta-data into the automated lab-book
Set of perl modules: facilitate the processing of the lab-book
